# dump1090 SBS-1 Message Forwarder to DataSet

This project provides a utility to capture SBS-1 format messages from dump1090's output and then forwards them to SentinelOne's DataSet for further analysis and storage.

## About ADS-B

_Automatic Dependent Surveillanceâ€“Broadcast (ADS-B)_ is a surveillance technology in which an aircraft determines its position via satellite navigation and periodically broadcasts it, enabling the aircraft to be tracked. The information can be received by air traffic control ground stations as a replacement for secondary radar. It can also be received by other aircraft, providing situational awareness and potentially allowing for self-separation. ADS-B is an integral part of the NextGen modernization program by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), aiming to replace radar-based surveillance and navigation systems.

## About dump1090 and SBS-1

`dump1090` is a popular ADS-B Mode S decoder built specifically for RTL-SDR devices. When run, it outputs aircraft data in SBS-1 format on port 30003. This format provides real-time information about airborne aircraft, including details like speed, position, altitude, and more.

## About DataSet (formerly known as Scalyr)

SentinelOne's DataSet, formerly known as Scalyr, offers high-speed logging and server metrics for engineers. It's known for its lightning-fast search capabilities. Engineers often rely on DataSet to troubleshoot server issues, understand application behaviors, and ensure smooth operations.

## Setting Up dump1090 with rtl_sdr

To get dump1090 producing SBS-1 messages from an RTL-SDR:

1. Ensure you have an RTL-SDR dongle.
2. Install `dump1090`:

   sudo apt-get install dump1090

3. Run `dump1090` in interactive mode:

   dump1090 --interactive

4. SBS-1 formatted data will be available on port `30003`. Ensure no firewall or other network restrictions block this port.

## Requirements

- Rust
- Cargo (Comes bundled with Rust)
- dump1090 (or a derivative, like [dump1090-fa](https://github.com/topics/dump1090-fa) or [dump1090-mutability](https://github.com/adsb-related-code/dump1090-mutability)) or [PiAware](https://www.flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. If not installed, [install Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
3. Compile the project:

   cargo build --release

This will create a self-contained binary `./target/release/adsb-rust-dataset`.

4. Ensure `dump1090` is running and emitting SBS-1 messages. By default with the `--net` argument, it will emit these messages on port `30003`.
5. Run the utility via command-line arguments or environment variables:

   - `--dump1090_host` or `DUMP1090_HOST`: Set the dump1090 host. e.g., `--dump1090_host=utilities.33901.cloud` or `DUMP1090_HOST=utilities.33901.cloud`
   - `--dump1090_port` or `DUMP1090_PORT`: Set the dump1090 port. e.g., `--dump1090_host=30003` or `DUMP1090_HOST=30003`
   - `--dataset_api_write_token` or `DATASET_API_WRITE_TOKEN`: Specify the API token used to write to DataSet

You can also optionally configure the batch size of how many messages to transmit to DataSet in each batch using the `--batch_size` argument or the `BATCH_SIZE` environment variable. If unset, this defaults to 500.

For example:
./adsb-rust-dataset --dataset_api_write_token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE --dump1090_host utilities.33901.cloud --dump1090_port 30003 --batch_size 10

## Creating a binary

Just run `cargo build --release` and a standalone binary `adsb` will be created in `/target/release`.

## Running Services with pmtr

[`pmtr`](https://troydhanson.github.io/pmtr/) is a versatile tool for running background services. It restarts services that fail and can manage both `dump1090` and this project as services.

Create a `pmtr.conf` configuration file in `/etc`:

    job {
      name dump1090
      cmd /path/to/dump1090 --net
    }

    job {
      name sbs1-forwarder
      cmd /path/to/adsb_binary
    }

Replace `/path/to/` with the appropriate paths.

Start the services with:

    pmtr -c /etc/pmtr.conf

Both `dump1090` and the SBS-1 forwarder will now run as managed background services. `pmtr` will restart them if they fail.

## Setting up pmtr as a launchd service

**Option 1: RPM**

A RHEL/CentOS 7 x86_64 RPM package for pmtr can be found [here](https://troydhanson.github.io/pmtr/).

**Option 2: Build from source**

1.  Install the prerequisite tools:

    _Ubuntu:_

        sudo apt install git build-essential autoconf automake

    _RedHat/CentOS:_

        sudo yum install git gcc autoconf automake make

2.  Clone pmtr:

        git clone https://github.com/troydhanson/pmtr.git

3.  Build and install:

        cd pmtr
        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure --bindir=/usr/bin --sysconfdir=/etc
        make
        sudo make install
        sudo touch /etc/pmtr.conf

4.  Set up initscript to start pmtr automatically at boot:

        cd initscripts
        sudo ./setup-initscript --auto

This is where pmtr reports on starting jobs, or on any errors in parsing the configuration file. Any output generated by the jobs also appears in the syslog by default.
